my favourite discord raiding tool, but no longer being maintained.

features:

mass server name changing
mass emoji deleting + creating (bug)
mass text spamming
mass webhook creating
mass role creating + colours changing + name changing
mass channel deleting + spamming
mass server icon changing
warning text before raiding
fast pinging
emoji support
threading support
the code is easy to understand as i just a beginner at python as well as discordpy at the time i making this bot.
